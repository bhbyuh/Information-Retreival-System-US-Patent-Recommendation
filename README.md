# US Patent Recommendation System

This repository contains an end-to-end semantic information retrieval system for recommending US patents. It uses semantic similarity and reranking techniques to return the most relevant patents to a user's query. The system is built with a Jupyter Notebook for data processing and a FastAPI backend for serving recommendations.
